fork and exec are used to launch new processes
when we fork a process it duplicates into two, the original process returns the PID, while new one returns 0
exec re0palces the current running process with a new one
on linux all processes spawn from a single process called systemd
you can see the process family tree with `ps ax --forest`

ptrace is used as the primary debugging utility on linux
its can do a lot of things
1. reading memory - PTRACE_PEEKDATA - reads 8 bytes of memory from given address
2. set up processes - PTRACE_ATTACH - attaches to the given process
	1. PTRACE_CONT - continue a currently blocked processs
3. send SIGKILL
it takes an enum that tells it what to do, and it takes a PID to know which process to do the thing to
it can also take 2 other parameters depending on what you want to do
returns -1 in case of error
